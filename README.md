# CI-Tools

This repository will be a generalized toolbox for most common CI tools and toolsets. This repository contains Quality of Life scripts and utilities to make server, codebase, networking setup/maintinance more streamlined and efficient. Some tool chain will be a link to a seperate repository as some of them are purpose built and have expanded far beyond what this repository was orginally designed for.
